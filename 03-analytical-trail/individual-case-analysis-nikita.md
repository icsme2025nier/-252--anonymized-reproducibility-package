# Individual Case Analysis: Nikita Korotov

## Participant Profile
- **Experience**: 2-3 years (full-stack, youngest participant)
- **Current Role**: Final-year BSc student, working on trading platform
- **AI Usage**: Multi-model approach (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor), 1 year with agents
- **Interview**: 2h 05m, conducted in English at participant's request, May 20, 2025

## Step 1: Initial Impressions and Reflexive Positioning

### First Listening Notes
Nikita's youth and relative inexperience create different phenomenological landscape. Most articulate about cognitive changes, most anxious about future implications. English preference despite weaker fluency suggests identity positioning.

### Researcher Reflexivity
His impatience ("I hope this won't take a whole hour?") triggered my own generational judgments. Had to bracket assumptions about "Gen Z laziness" to hear his genuine anxieties. His resistance to discussing feelings required adjusted approach.

## Step 2: Experiential Themes Emerging from Analysis

### Theme 1: Epistemic Vertigo
**"Like being in a weird dream"**

Most vivid metaphor for AI knowledge:
- "It feels like you were in a dream... it was somehow so real because you were in dream, but you also realised that everything is so weird" [1:24:18]
- Knowledge that dissolves under scrutiny
- Reality-unreality boundary blurring

### Theme 2: Accelerated Identity Transformation  
**"Java developer to software engineer in 3 years"**

Fastest professional evolution:
- "A few years ago... I described myself more as a Java developer... And AI don't have to focus on the specific language right now" [1:56:01]
- Compression of typical decade-long progression
- Both opportunity and anxiety

### Theme 3: The Competence Paradox Embodied
**"Great developer with no skills"**

Most explicit about simultaneous feelings:
- "It's really mixed and hard to describe, but it was both at the same time I was feeling great... and at the same time you feel like you're completely not competitive" [54:40]
- Living contradiction without resolution
- Emotional complexity beyond age

### Theme 4: Cognitive Colonization
**"Making prompts in my head"**

Unique awareness of mental restructuring:
- "The more I use AI, the more it feels like I'm constantly making prompts in my head. I even catch myself making prompts for myself" [1:53:30]
- Thought patterns reformatted
- Metacognitive concern

### Theme 5: Temporal Anxiety
**"Future sleepless nights"**

Anticipatory technical debt:
- "I was already realising that I will be rewriting all the code later. So I'll take sleepless nights" [52:56]
- Present efficiency, future suffering
- Time consciousness unusual for age

### Theme 6: Active Resistance Strategy
**"Minimizing AI presence"**

Conscious limitation despite capability:
- "I want to solve difficult problems that are actually challenging me on my own... AI is just used for something that I could solve myself easily" [2:02:04]
- Deliberate competence preservation
- Fighting cognitive dependency

## Step 3: Psychological Needs Analysis (SDT Lens)

### Autonomy
- **Binary control model**: "I was in charge, definitely. I was writing the code. I was accepting"
- **Orchestrator identity**: "Leader of small team" despite working alone
- **Resistance as autonomy**: Actively minimizing AI to preserve self

### Competence
- **Radically ambivalent**: Greatest highs and lows
- **Scope expansion**: Language-specific to universal engineer
- **Intelligence anxiety**: "Makes you kind of dumber"

### Relatedness
- **AI as safe space**: "Doesn't judge me" for stupid questions
- **Human preference maintained**: "People have experience, not just knowledge"
- **Communication changes**: Interactions becoming "robotic, less human"

## Step 4: Temporal Dimensions

### Past
- Recent enough to remember pre-AI learning
- Traditional identity ("Java developer") still fresh

### Present
- Rapid transformation phase
- Conscious of ongoing changes
- Active negotiation with AI presence

### Future
- Most future-anxious participant
- Sees narrowing worldviews
- Plans selective AI use

## Step 5: Experiential Qualities

### Surreal Affect
Unique phenomenological territory:
- Dream metaphors
- Reality distortion
- Epistemic uncertainty

### Metacognitive Intensity
Highest self-awareness:
- Notices thought pattern changes
- Questions own cognition
- Philosophical beyond years

### Ambivalence Management
Lives in contradictions:
- Uses AI while resisting
- Benefits while warning
- Advances while preserving

## Step 6: Unique Contributions to Cross-Case Analysis

1. **Generational Perspective**: Only Gen Z voice, different relationship to technology
2. **Epistemic Concerns**: Unique focus on knowledge quality and worldview narrowing  
3. **Surreal Phenomenology**: Dream states and reality distortion
4. **Active Resistance**: Most conscious limitation strategy
5. **Cognitive Colonization**: Explicit thought pattern recognition

## Step 7: Key Interpretative Insights

### The Digital Native's Dilemma
Nikita faces unique challenges:
- No nostalgic "before times" like seniors
- AI-integrated from career start
- Must build identity with/against AI

### Wisdom Through Vulnerability
Youngest but philosophically sophisticated:
- Recognizes cognitive changes others miss
- Articulates epistemic concerns
- Questions progress narrative

### Resistance as Self-Preservation
Active limitation strategy reveals:
- Awareness of dependency risks
- Deliberate competence building
- Long-term thinking despite youth

## Step 8: The Information Ecology Concern

Nikita's unique contribution on knowledge:

**Google Era**: "We had many sources... wider worldview"
**AI Era**: "Our view narrows"

This represents:
- Generational perspective on information
- Curation vs. exploration tension
- Democratic vs. filtered knowledge

## Summary: Nikita's Lived Experience

Nikita embodies **accelerated transformation with conscious resistance**. As the youngest participant, he lacks the stable pre-AI identity that anchors others, yet demonstrates remarkable awareness of AI's cognitive and epistemic impacts. His experience is marked by extreme tensions held in active suspension.

The "weird dream" metaphor captures something essential about Gen Z's AI experience - a reality that seems functional but feels fundamentally unstable. Unlike older participants who compare AI to familiar tools or colleagues, Nikita experiences it as reality-altering technology that must be carefully managed.

His competence paradox is most acute - simultaneously feeling like a "great developer" and having "no skills." This isn't cognitive dissonance but lived reality for a generation whose entire professional identity formed alongside AI. The accelerated transformation from "Java developer" to "software engineer" compresses normal career progression into uncanny speed.

Most significantly, Nikita demonstrates sophisticated resistance strategies. His conscious minimization of AI presence, despite acknowledging its benefits, reveals deep understanding of cognitive dependency risks. The observation about "making prompts in my head" shows remarkable metacognitive awareness.

His concerns about epistemic narrowing - how AI curates rather than expands worldviews - represent crucial generational wisdom. Having grown up with both Google's information abundance and AI's curated responses, he uniquely perceives the trade-offs.

Nikita's experience suggests that younger developers may:
- Experience more extreme identity fluidity
- Develop sophisticated resistance strategies
- Articulate novel epistemic concerns
- Live in sustained ambivalence
- Actively manage cognitive colonization

His final stance - using AI for easy tasks while preserving hard problems for himself - represents mature strategy for maintaining human development in an AI-saturated environment.
