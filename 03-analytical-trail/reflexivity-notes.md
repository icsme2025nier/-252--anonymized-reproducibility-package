# Researcher Reflexivity Notes

## Researcher Positioning

As a fifth-year PhD student researching AI pair programming, I bring both technical expertise and personal investment to this study. My experience spans all three AI modes (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), shaping my interpretative lens in important ways.

### Initial Assumptions (Bracketed Before Analysis)
1. **Control**: Developers maintain control as "navigators" while AI serves as "pilot"
2. **Efficiency**: AI delegation enables focus on interesting problems
3. **Satisfaction**: Routine task automation increases developer happiness
4. **Team dynamics**: AI creates helpful "third party" in pair programming

### How These Assumptions Were Challenged

**Martin's grief** over commoditized expertise resonated deeply: 
> "We both remember when elegant algorithms distinguished masters."

This forced me to confront my own attachment to technical mastery and recognize loss alongside gain.

**Jiri's team trust concerns** revealed collective costs I'd overlooked in my individual-focused framework. My assumption about AI as helpful "third party" crumbled when confronted with his experience of "extreme distrust" in teams.

**Nick's cognitive colonization** ("making prompts in my head") made me recognize my own cognitive reformatting. I hadn't noticed how deeply prompt engineering had infiltrated my thinking until his articulation made it visible.

## Evolving Interpretations

### Early Analysis Phase
Initially coded experiences as simply "positive" or "negative." The data resisted this binary, demanding more nuanced interpretation.

### Middle Phase
Recognized the **paradoxical nature** of experiences:
- Competence simultaneously enhanced and threatened  
- Control both surrendered and maintained
- Relationships both enriched and impoverished

### Final Phase
Understood these weren't contradictions to resolve but **lived tensions to preserve**. The phenomenological commitment to ambiguity became crucial.

## Power Dynamics and Relationships

### With Participants
- **Students** (Nick): Worked to minimize professor-student dynamic
- **Senior developers** (Martin, Michael): Managed my junior status carefully
- **Peers** (Marek, Jiri): Easiest rapport but risk of over-identification

### Language and Culture
Czech-English code-switching revealed my own linguistic assumptions. Technical discussions flowed in English while emotional content emerged more authentically in Czech. This shaped both interview dynamics and interpretation.

## Emotional Responses During Analysis

### Marek's Interview
His nail-biting anxiety triggered memories of my own frustrated debugging sessions. Had to pause analysis to separate his experience from mine.

### Martin's "Final Touch" Philosophy  
Initially dismissed as resistance, later understood as sophisticated autonomy preservation. My bias toward "full AI adoption" needed checking.

### Nick's Surrealism
His "weird dream" metaphor for AI knowledge initially seemed overblown. Only through sustained engagement did I grasp the profound epistemological uncertainty he articulated.

## Methodological Tensions

### Phenomenology vs. Technical Detail
Constantly navigated between needing enough technical context and maintaining experiential focus. My engineering background both helped (understanding context) and hindered (getting lost in implementation details).

### Individual vs. Patterns
IPA demands idiographic depth, yet NIER format requires concise patterns. This tension shaped every analytical decision.

## What I Learned About My Own AI Use

Through participants' mirrors, recognized my own:
- **Delegation pendulum** swings
- **Competence anxieties** despite productivity gains  
- **Anthropomorphization** of successful AI interactions
- **Cognitive colonization** by prompt engineering

## Final Reflection

This research transformed my understanding from "AI as tool" to "AI as existential negotiation." The phenomenological method didn't just reveal participants' experiencesâ€”it made visible the water I swim in daily as an AI-augmented researcher.

The hardest part wasn't analyzing others' experiences but maintaining sufficient reflexive distance from phenomena I live daily. Yet this proximity also enabled recognition of subtle experiential nuances that might escape researchers without deep AI collaboration experience.
