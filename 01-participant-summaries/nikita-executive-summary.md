# Nikita Korotov - Executive Summary

## Opening & Context

Nikita Korotov is a Gen-Z economics student nearing graduation with 2-3 years of programming experience, primarily through personal projects. He represents a younger generation's perspective on AI adoption, describing himself as having "quite a lot of experience in programming field" (5:03) despite his relatively short tenure. His current work spans two contrasting projects: a crypto trading platform with behavioral bias monitoring for his bachelor's thesis, and a personal project connecting romantic partners through gaming integration.

His AI usage pattern reveals a multi-model approach, regularly switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor IDE based on task requirements. He articulates clear preferences: "chat GPT is better at... business way of thinking... with generic prompts and for example, Claude is better at raw coding" (18:34-19:02).

## Key Experiences

### Experience 1: The Electron Desktop App - From Validation to Frustration

Nikita's journey began with seeking validation for a desktop application idea. He started with ChatGPT for business validation, then moved to Claude in Cursor for implementation. The initial success was met with cold indifference: "I did not really feel anything just because it was a default task and I expected AI to complete it without any mistakes... It was just a basic working task. As for example, I would just expect colleague to say hello to me at the beginning of the day" (36:23-37:13).

However, this emotional flatness quickly transformed into frustration when implementing the first feature (an on-screen keyboard). Despite AI generating working code, Nikita recognized fundamental flaws: "AI basically, unless you explicitly ask them would not focus on scalable or just code that aligns well with solid principles... The code AI provided was working but was horrible I would say" (45:42). This realization led to a spectrum of frustration: "I was already realising that I will be rewriting all the code later. So I'll take sleepless nights... extended stress just to reiterate all the code" (52:56-53:40).

### Experience 2: Deep Research Gone Wrong - The Kahneman Theory Investigation

For his thesis work on behavioral economics, Nikita attempted to use ChatGPT's deep research feature to understand Kahneman and Tversky's theories. After 11 minutes of processing, the AI provided an overview that initially seemed helpful but ultimately proved problematic.

Nikita described the experience with a striking metaphor: "I had strange feeling of... It might sound strange, but it feels like you had a kind of weird... dream... it was somehow so real because you were in dream, but you also realised that everything is so weird" (1:24:18-1:25:03). His fact-checking revealed fundamental inaccuracies: "When you read it through just like briefly, it all makes sense. But as soon as you actually start to read into details... Somehow they do not align and just something is weird" (1:25:22-1:26:10).

### Experience 3: Collaborative AI Use - Testing Ideas with a Friend

In a more positive experience, Nikita described using AI collaboratively with a master's degree colleague to discuss data aggregation solutions. They used AI for two purposes: translating complex ideas and rapidly prototyping solutions. "Both sides of the discussion prompted AI with the solution... and asked them if this could potentially work and the results... were sent to the chat continuously" (1:41:55).

While this accelerated their problem-solving, Nikita noted the trade-offs: "It feels more robotic, I would say it feels like less human... sometimes it feels like you're not communicating with people... it feels like you're just communicating with AI, but AI has... this chain has a middle man of a human being" (1:42:42-1:43:01).

## Core Themes

### The Competence Paradox
Nikita articulates a profound psychological split: "It's really mixed and hard to describe, but it was both at the same time I was feeling great, because it feels like you're a great developer because you're implementing features on the way and at the same time you feel like you're completely not competitive... you have no skills, it's somehow both at the same time" (54:40-55:20).

### From Specialist to Generalist Identity
AI has fundamentally shifted Nikita's professional self-concept: "A few years ago... I described myself more as a for example, a Java developer... And AI don't have to focus on the specific language right now, so it allows me to focus more on other technologies... So I would now say my describe myself as a software engineer, not just a Java developer" (1:56:01-1:57:04). He sees this transformation as accelerated: "Before AI I would think that this moment would come when I would be around 40 or 30... But now I feel like this moment can come much earlier" (1:57:12-1:57:38).

### The Narrowing Information Landscape
Nikita expresses deep concern about AI's impact on information seeking: "In era of Googling... we had a lot of sources of information. So we actually had a wider worldview... And nowadays, when people just ask AI to give them information... It narrows the world view" (2:00:43). He fears this will result in people losing the ability to "search and evaluate the information" independently.

### Maintaining Human Primacy
Despite extensive AI use, Nikita maintains a clear hierarchy: "I still think that people... are way more experienced than AI, especially if they know their stuff" (1:45:16-1:45:28). He actively tries to "minimise the level of AI presence in my life" and reserves difficult problems for personal solving: "When you use AI, not just a tool to learn, but a tool to solve your problems... It actually makes you kind of dumber" (2:03:17-2:04:07).

## Professional Identity Impact

Nikita's relationship with AI tools has created a complex professional identity characterized by acceleration and anxiety. While AI has enabled him to transcend language-specific expertise and become a "software engineer" rather than just a "Java developer," this transformation comes with significant psychological costs.

He describes feeling like "a team leader of a small group" where he knows "how to do the things, but you're just not doing them but just saying how they should be done" (1:04:14). This shift from implementer to orchestrator represents both an elevation in conceptual thinking and a loss of hands-on expertise.

The prompt engineering mindset has infiltrated his cognitive processes: "The more I use AI, the more it feels like I'm constantly making prompts in my head. I even catch myself making prompts for myself" (1:53:30-1:54:07). This restructuring extends to how he plans and communicates, focusing on "what's important, what's not important, what should be included in the context."

Nikita summarizes his relationship with AI agents with telling ambivalence: "Good. Could be better... It definitely makes me a better software engineer for sure. At some point of view, but it comes with payoffs that I have to deal with" (2:00:59-2:01:26). His final stance reveals a deliberate strategy of selective engagement: "I want to solve difficult problems that are actually challenging me on my own... AI is just used for something that I could solve myself easily, but just don't want to waste time on" (2:02:04-2:02:46).

## Post-Script: Researcher's Live Notes

**Post-interview participant notes:**
- The interview was interesting, but he would prefer non-phenomenological approaches
- He dislikes that phenomenological interviews focus heavily on feelings
- For him, AI is more about opinions and thinking
- He views AI as a tool

**Researcher's reflections:**
- Conducting a phenomenologically informed interview with a Gen-Z participant proved challenging
  - Not open to sharing or experiencing his feelings
  - Gen-Z appears "lazy" and ungrateful: despite spending dozens of conversations averaging 2-4 hours with the participant, he asked before this interview: "I hope this won't take a whole hour?"
- The interview proceeded without particular incident, but I would rate it as below average in terms of both content and form
- Will record more through retrospective analysis tomorrow
