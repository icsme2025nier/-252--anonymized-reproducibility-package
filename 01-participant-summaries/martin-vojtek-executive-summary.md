# Martin Vojtek - Executive Summary

## Opening & Context

Martin Vojtek is a seasoned software architect with over 20 years of experience, currently leading a team of approximately 20 people. His role spans multiple technical areas, positioning him as a senior technical leader who has witnessed the evolution of software development practices. He uses AI assistants daily, primarily GitHub Copilot and Gemini (beta version), mostly within his development environment for programming tasks, though he also uses browser-based AI for more complex queries.

His approach to AI reflects both pragmatism and caution: "I'm still very conservative, so I always just copy [code] for now, I don't accept much yet... but that will probably change over time as I start to trust more" (Part 1, 24:25). This conservative stance stems from a past experience where AI-generated code passed his review but later received negative feedback, making him more vigilant about AI outputs.

## Key Experiences

### Experience 1: Flutter UI Development - The 80% Solution

Martin's recent experience involved adding a filter button to a tree structure in a Flutter application using Gemini in Android Studio. The task highlighted both AI's capabilities and limitations in understanding context. Initially, the agent claimed it couldn't see his code, providing only generic algorithms. After resolving this, the collaboration required about 5 iterations.

The agent successfully generated the UI components and basic structure, but failed to create proper filtering logic due to lack of database context: "The agent doesn't have access to the database... it would be somehow complicated to export some data for it to look at. So it was easier to just write those few lines of code" (Part 1, 19:13-19:59). Martin completed the remaining 20% himself, focusing on the backend logic where he felt more competent.

His satisfaction was nuanced: "I was very satisfied with the process... the part I don't want to understand much, like UI... it's nice when something is proposed and it works" (Part 1, 20:29-22:02). This experience crystallized his emerging work pattern: AI handles domains outside his expertise while he maintains control over his core competencies.

### Experience 2: Architecture and Capacity Planning

Martin regularly uses AI for architectural brainstorming and technical decision-making. He describes using AI to compare different providers, frameworks, and calculate infrastructure needs: "I describe all the various parameters and it completely calculates how much capacity I need... I don't have to do complex forecasts or calculations in Excel anymore" (Part 1, 36:58-38:19).

This shift has fundamentally changed his approach to technical leadership, moving from detailed implementation knowledge to conceptual understanding: "I need to understand technologies and frameworks, but I don't need to know exactly what functions or components are there" (Part 1, 34:43-35:48).

### Experience 3: Supporting His Daughter's Education

In a revealing personal example, Martin described helping his daughter with international statistics and calculus exams. When encountering topics he hadn't studied, they now turn to AI agents: "The agent calculates the differentials somehow... and shows the process, so then we try to understand together how that specific example is calculated" (Part 1, 39:10-40:11).

This experience illustrates AI's role in democratizing knowledge: "All this knowledge is easily accessible now... the agent describes it with concrete solutions and processes, maybe 10 pages long, nicely described and explained" (Part 1, 40:11-40:54).

## Core Themes

### From Programmer to Reviewer-Manager

Martin articulates a profound shift in his professional identity: "From being the main programmer, I've become more like a reviewer... or expert who just adds some advanced touches... I just watch over the agent to make sure everything makes sense. I'm like a manager" (Part 1, 29:18-30:06). This transformation represents both a loss and an evolution.

The pride he once felt in writing complex code has evaporated: "In the past when there was no AI, I was proud that I could write lots of lines... complex solutions that colleagues had trouble with. Today all this is already in AI... it's become a commodity" (Part 2, 5:14-7:25). Now, value lies in quickly understanding AI proposals and adding the "final touch" that humanizes the code.

### The Importance of the "Final Touch"

Martin's need to add personal modifications to AI-generated code serves multiple purposes. It provides ownership: "It gives me more authorship to the code... I've somehow humanized it, so it's ultimately my creation" (Part 2, 7:40-8:04). This practice maintains his engagement and sense of purpose in an increasingly automated workflow.

Interestingly, he's developed a split accountability model: "When I modify the code and make changes there, I consider it mine. And when there are bugs, I consider it the agent's" (Part 2, 9:03-10:05). This psychological mechanism helps him navigate the ambiguity of human-AI collaboration.

### AI as Stress Reducer and Cognitive Offload

Martin emphasizes AI's role in reducing workplace stress: "When someone doesn't understand something, they can immediately get the information... find contacts of people who dealt with it and then contact them. So I think agents reduce stress quite a bit" (Part 2, 16:39-17:39). 

AI has become pervasive across all life domains: "It permeates all aspects of life - work, household, and family" (Part 2, 20:21). From insurance comparisons to apartment renovations to educational support, AI serves as a universal assistant that provides "more information" for better decision-making.

### The Vanishing Expert

Martin observes a fundamental shift in what constitutes professional value: "I feel like I'm no longer an expert in anything, but I'm somehow capable... I just use soft skills and general logical thinking or problem-solving" (Part 2, 48:03-48:25). The traditional markers of expertise - deep knowledge of language specifics or framework internals - are becoming obsolete.

Looking ahead, he predicts this trend will accelerate: "In 5 years maybe it will already be obsolete... People won't need to understand programming deeply. It will be more about making the right decisions and solving problems using all these tools" (Part 2, 22:02-23:34).

## Professional Identity Impact

Martin's two-decade career provides unique perspective on AI's transformative impact. He positions himself as part of a transitional generation: "I have the advantage of experience... I remember times when I programmed without agents, so I understand things from the ground up" (Part 2, 20:53-22:02). This foundational knowledge enables him to effectively evaluate AI outputs and add meaningful contributions.

His new identity centers on two core competencies: problem-solving skills and soft skills. These remain high-value because they involve human judgment, context understanding, and strategic thinking that AI cannot yet replicate. His ability to "rationally evaluate whether the output makes sense" (Part 2, 23:34) becomes crucial as AI handles increasing technical complexity.

The shift has practical implications for career development. Martin worries about technical interviews: "I'm practically capable of doing anything, but if someone asks me a specific question about a framework, that would be a problem" (Part 1, 35:48). The mismatch between traditional evaluation methods and AI-augmented capabilities creates new anxieties.

Despite the losses - the pride in crafting elegant solutions, the deep technical mastery - Martin maintains optimism. His relationship with AI agents is "improving constantly... I'm increasingly surprised by what it can handle" (Part 2, 50:58-51:45). He views AI as a tool requiring active discovery: "It will be important to discover what all the agent can help with... it can completely change my work if I give it more time" (Part 2, 51:45).

Martin's journey illustrates the complex navigation required of experienced developers: leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining relevance, finding new sources of professional satisfaction, and preparing for a future where traditional programming expertise may be "obsolete." His emphasis on maintaining the "final touch" suggests a path forward - not resistance to AI, but thoughtful integration that preserves human agency and creativity in the development process.

## Post-Script: Researcher's Live Notes

**Interview context:**
- Interview was conducted at a faster pace, participant had exactly 60 minutes
- This was somewhat disappointing as I couldn't explore in depth
- However, I believe he provided substantial information that will require time to process and realize, as I didn't have much time during the interview itself

**Key observations:**
- At first glance, I'm unsure what's most interesting for others - for me it was a fairly predictable interview without the surrealistic descriptions seen with the Gen-Z student
- Emerging insights:
  - No longer a specialist in various technologies, nor interested in becoming one
  - "Yes, it was a nice period when I knew the intricacies of Java, and it was valuable"
  - AI barely changes teamwork:
    - Don't use AI during meetings
    - Frequency of human contact remains unchanged
    - AI doesn't replace human contact
  - On the other hand:
    - They have automatic code reviews
    - Sometimes know that certain tasks won't take two weeks anymore due to AI efficiency, implying everyone on the team uses agents (willingly or not)

**Notable points:**
- Highlighted "two" main skills but actually mentioned three:
  - Soft skills
  - Fundamentals of human thinking
  - Problem-solving skills

**Follow-up questions for future research:**
- What's most essential for effective work with AI:
  - Soft skills, fundamentals of human thinking, problem-solving skills?
  - Language proficiency, i.e., ability to abstract, think algorithmically, and express precisely thanks to rich vocabulary, whether general or domain-specific?
- What would he recommend to junior developers or what would he expect universities to teach?

**Follow-up interview notes (30.5.2025):**
- Key insight: "The agent generates a gray solution, but a person wants it to reflect their personality and style"
