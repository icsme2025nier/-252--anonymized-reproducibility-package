# Cross-Case Synthesis Process Documentation

## Overview
This document details how we moved from individual case analyses to cross-case patterns while maintaining IPA's idiographic commitment.

## Individual Case Summaries

### Martin Vojtek (20 years, CTO)
**Key Themes:**
- Identity metamorphosis: programmer → reviewer/manager
- Pride erosion: expertise commoditization  
- Ownership rituals: "final touch" preservation
- Asymmetric attribution: success internalized, failure externalized
- Meta-competence: knowing when AI "makes sense"

### Marek Mikula (7 years, Full-stack)
**Key Themes:**
- Embodied technology stress: nail-biting, escape behaviors
- Competence expansion: specialist → generalist
- Anthropomorphic relationships: tool ↔ companion based on performance
- Domain-dependent ethics: "cheating" in familiar areas
- Flow transformation: 2-hour immersive AI dialogues

### Michael Hakl (5 years, Researcher-Developer)  
**Key Themes:**
- Delegation calculus: systematic outsourcing decisions
- Scientific skepticism: transparency and reproducibility concerns
- Future-oriented identity: developer → architect trajectory
- Pragmatic instrumentalism: AI as "laborer"
- Organizational tensions: technical reality vs. management dreams

### Jiri Otoupal (8 years, Senior Developer)
**Key Themes:**
- Radical control strategies: memory erasure
- Team trust erosion: "extreme distrust"
- Risk compartmentalization: personal projects only
- Efficiency motivation: skip boring, reach interesting
- Agent as junior: directionless but manageable

### Nikita Korotov (3 years, Student)
**Key Themes:**
- Epistemic vertigo: "weird dream" knowledge states
- Accelerated identity shift: Java developer → software engineer
- Cognitive colonization: thinking in prompts
- Temporal anxiety: future "sleepless nights"
- Active resistance: minimizing AI presence

## Pattern Identification Process

### Step 1: Theme Frequency Matrix

| Theme Category | Martin | Marek | Michael | Jiri | Nikita |
|----------------|--------|--------|---------|------|---------|
| Control negotiation | ++ | ++ | ++ | ++ | + |
| Competence paradox | ++ | + | + | + | ++ |
| Relational shifts | + | + | + | ++ | ++ |
| Identity evolution | ++ | + | + | - | ++ |
| Embodied responses | - | ++ | + | + | + |
| Temporal transformation | + | ++ | + | + | ++ |

**Legend**: ++ Strongly present | + Present | - Minimal/Absent

### Step 2: Convergent Patterns

#### Universal Experiences (4-5 participants)
1. **Control as ongoing negotiation** - Never simply lost or maintained
2. **Competence simultaneously enhanced and threatened**
3. **AI relationships vary by context and performance**
4. **Some form of identity work required**

#### Common Experiences (3 participants)
1. **Embodied stress responses** (Marek, Michael, Jiri)
2. **Temporal/flow disruption** (Marek, Nikita, Martin)
3. **Team dynamic concerns** (Jiri, Nikita, Michael)

#### Unique Contributions
- **Martin**: "Final touch" strategy
- **Jiri**: Memory erasure technique
- **Nick**: Epistemic narrowing concerns
- **Michael**: Explainable AI vision

### Step 3: SDT Dimension Mapping

#### Autonomy Patterns
- **Delegation pendulum**: All participants swing between control and surrender
- **Strategic withdrawal**: Option to abandon AI preserves autonomy
- **Meta-autonomy**: Choosing when/how to use AI becomes new autonomy expression

#### Competence Patterns  
- **Hollow vs. Robust**: Efficiency without understanding vs. hard-won mastery
- **Domain-dependent confidence**: Stronger in unfamiliar territories
- **Temporal debt**: Today's efficiency, tomorrow's confusion

#### Relatedness Patterns
- **Anthropomorphization gradient**: Tool → Assistant → Colleague → Threat
- **Human relationship reorganization**: Technical questions to AI, social to humans
- **Trust as achievement**: Built through successful interactions

### Step 4: Superordinate Theme Development

From 200+ emergent themes across cases, we identified 4 superordinate themes:

1. **Control as Existential Negotiation**
   - Not binary but ongoing
   - Multiple strategies (erasure, orchestration, withdrawal)
   - Meta-level autonomy preserved

2. **The Competence Paradox**
   - Enhancement and threat coexist
   - Context determines experience
   - New temporal dynamics

3. **Relatedness as Spectrum**
   - From tool to threat
   - Context-dependent positioning
   - Synthetic satisfaction possible

4. **Temporal Identity Work**
   - Past expertise, present transition, future uncertainty
   - Generational positioning
   - Active identity construction

## Quality Assurance

### Maintaining Idiographic Commitment
- Each pattern grounded in specific participant experiences
- Divergent cases highlighted, not suppressed
- Individual voices preserved in final write-up

### Audit Trail
- Movement from raw data → emergent themes → patterns traceable
- Reflexive notes document interpretive decisions
- Team discussions recorded for transparency

### Member Checking
- Summaries shared with participants
- Feedback incorporated where provided
- Divergent interpretations noted

## Theoretical Integration

SDT provided sensitizing concepts but didn't constrain analysis:
- Some experiences don't map cleanly to single needs
- New phenomena emerged (e.g., cognitive colonization)
- Theory expanded through empirical findings
