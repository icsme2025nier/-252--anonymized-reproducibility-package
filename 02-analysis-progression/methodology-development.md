# IPA Methodology Development for Software Engineering Research

## Evolution of Our Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Framework (April 2025)
Our initial IPA framework drew heavily from Smith et al. (2009) but required adaptation for software engineering contexts:

**Key Adaptations:**
- Integration of technical artifact discussions within phenomenological inquiry
- Balancing concrete programming experiences with emotional/embodied dimensions
- Navigating participants' tendency toward technical explanations vs. lived experience

### Phase 2: Pilot Interview Learnings (March 2025)
Pilot interview revealed need for:
- More explicit phenomenological framing in opening
- Specific probes for embodied experiences
- Permission-giving for discussing feelings about code

### Phase 3: Refined Protocol (April-May 2025)
Based on early interviews, we refined our approach:

## Four-Column Analysis Framework

Our analysis evolved through several iterations:

### Version 1: Traditional IPA
| Raw Excerpt | Descriptive | Linguistic | Conceptual |

**Issues:** Lost reflexive insights, insufficient audit trail

### Version 2: Enhanced with Reflexivity
| Raw Excerpt | Descriptive | Linguistic | Conceptual | Reflexive Notes |

**Improvement:** Better bracketing, clearer researcher positioning

### Final Version: SDT-Integrated
| Raw Excerpt | Descriptive | Linguistic/Pragmatic | Conceptual/Interpretative | SDT Mapping |

**Benefits:** Theoretical integration while maintaining phenomenological depth

## Analytical Process Refinements

### 1. Re-immersion Protocol
- **Initial approach**: Just re-listening
- **Evolved to**: 45-minute structured re-immersion
  - First 15 min: Listen without notes at 1x speed
  - Next 20 min: Note experiential qualities (tone, pauses, energy)
  - Final 10 min: Reflexive memo on researcher responses

### 2. Emergent Theme Development
**Early attempts**: Too many themes (50-70 per participant)

**Refined approach**:
1. Extract all conceptual notes
2. Cluster by experiential similarity (not topical)
3. Collapse to 30-40 emergent themes
4. Map to SDT dimensions
5. Identify cross-cutting patterns

### 3. Cross-Case Analysis
**Challenge**: Maintaining idiographic depth while finding patterns

**Solution**: Presence/Strength Matrix
- ++ Strongly present
- + Present  
- Â± Ambivalent
- - Minimal/Absent

This preserved individual uniqueness while enabling pattern recognition.

## Key Methodological Insights

### 1. The Phenomenological Interview in SE
Software developers initially resist experiential questions. Successful strategies:
- Anchor in specific coding situations
- Use "How did that feel?" after technical descriptions
- Validate both technical and emotional experiences
- Allow technical discussion as entry point to experience

### 2. Managing Technical Complexity
Balance needed between:
- Sufficient technical detail for context
- Maintaining focus on lived experience
- Not getting lost in implementation details

### 3. Cultural Considerations
Czech-English code-switching revealed culturally embedded meanings:
- Technical terms often in English
- Emotional expressions more authentic in Czech
- Metaphors culturally specific

## Quality Criteria Applied

Following Yardley (2000) and IPA guidelines:

### 1. Sensitivity to Context
- Deep engagement with each participant's professional context
- Attention to power dynamics (student vs. CTO)
- Cultural sensitivity in bilingual analysis

### 2. Commitment and Rigor
- 60-200 minute interviews
- Systematic four-column analysis
- Complete audit trail
- Multiple analytical iterations

### 3. Transparency and Coherence
- Clear documentation of analytical decisions
- Reflexive notes throughout
- Coherent narrative from data to themes

### 4. Impact and Importance
- Novel insights into developer-AI experiences
- Practical implications for tool design
- Theoretical contribution to SDT in AI contexts

## Lessons for Future IPA Studies in SE

1. **Participant Selection**: Mix of experience levels reveals different phenomenological landscapes
2. **Interview Duration**: 90+ minutes needed for phenomenological depth
3. **Technical Anchoring**: Specific code examples ground abstract experiences
4. **Reflexivity**: Researcher's technical background both helps and hinders
5. **Language**: Allow natural code-switching if applicable
6. **Analysis Time**: Budget 6-8 hours per participant for thorough IPA
