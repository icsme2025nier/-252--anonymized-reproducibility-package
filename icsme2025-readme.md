### 5. Ethics Documentation
- `informed-consent-template.pdf`: Template used for participant consent

## Methodological Approach

We employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) following Smith et al. (2009), adapted for software engineering research contexts. Our analysis proceeded through:

1. **Individual case analysis**: Deep engagement with each participant's lived experience
2. **Four-column analysis**: Descriptive → Linguistic → Conceptual → Reflexive noting
3. **Theme development**: From emergent themes to superordinate patterns
4. **Cross-case synthesis**: Identifying convergent and divergent experiences

## Using This Package

### For Reviewers
- Start with `/04-verification/timestamp-concordance.md` to verify quotes
- Review `/03-analytical-trail/` for complete audit trail
- See `/02-analysis-progression/` for methodological transparency

### For Researchers
- `/02-analysis-progression/methodology-development.md` provides IPA guidance for SE contexts
- Theme development forms demonstrate systematic phenomenological analysis
- Reflexivity notes illustrate researcher positioning and bias management
